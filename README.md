# AIRCADE
Anechoic and IR Convolution-based Auralization Data Compilation Ensemble

[AIRCADE](https://zenodo.org/record/7818761#.ZDrig3bMJPZ) is a data-compilation ensemble of anechoic [speech and song samples](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.ZDrm6HbMJPY), together with [acoustic guitar sounds](https://zenodo.org/record/3371780#.YcCtvmjMJPY), with original annotations pertinent to emotion recognition and Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Moreover, it includes a selection of [impulse response (IR) samples](https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/) with varying RT values, providing a wide range of reverberation conditions for evaluation. It is primarily intended to serve as a resource for researchers in the field of dereverberation, particularly for data-driven approaches.

This data-compilation can be used together with a Python script, for generating an auralized data ensemble of combinations between the anechoic and IR data. Additionally, the provided metadata also allows for further analysis and investigation of the performance of dereverberation algorithms under different conditions.
